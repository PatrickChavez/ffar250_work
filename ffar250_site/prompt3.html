  <h1 class="prompt1Title">An Illustrated Week</h1>

  <!-- Opening Statement -->
  <article class="prompt3Article show-on-scroll">
    <p class="aboutDescription">
      It’s the end of the Fall Semester. It sucks. At this point I’m so stressed that I might just puke at any minute. As the weeks go by and my brain slowly implodes, I’ll use this opportunity to illustrate by feelings each day for a week. This
      small deviation from my normal routine of assignments, commitments and existential dread should help to calm my nerves, even for a little bit.

    <p>
      1. I will draw one illustration a day. The illustration can be anything from an event that happened to me on a particular day to my overall feelings of a certain moment in a day.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. A caption will accompany said illustration, usually about the context of how the picture was made.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. I will make note of the times when I slept to when I woke up. With this, I should have a better grasp of my sleep schedule.

      Assignments are more complicated than I thought. I visited the dentist today; it went better than I expected. I’m sleepy; woke up fairly early today (10:40pm to 4:45am).

      Extremely regular day. Lots of procrastination. The laziness of this picture is palpable (oh well). Slept around 10:30pm, woke up around 5:30am. Decent sleep for once.

    <p class="aboutDescription">
      Normal day. Could not stop thinking about the poor drawing quality of Day 2. This day’s picture is more-or-less the same, but I like the expression of my avatar. Assignments and personal drama keep me anxious but I’m managing. Woke up very
      early today (slept around 10:30pm, woke up around 4: 30am); felt drowsy all day, but a short nap made me feel a little better.

    <p class="aboutDescription">
      Somewhat relaxing day. Took a long walk outside. I was pelted by a sudden snowfall, but it didn’t last long. Going outside helps to calm the nerves (to an extent; it’s much more fun to be outside with friends). Felt a bit scatterbrained
      throughout the afternoon. Woke up very early (around 3:50am), but managed to go back to sleep and arise around 6am. I sept at 10:30pm.

      <p>
        Met up with a friend today. We ended up spending the entire afternoon hanging out and getting lost in the suburbs. The conversations ended up getting really personal; we mostly talked about family and what our plans for the future were. I
        slept around 12am and woke up around 5:30am (couldn’t go back to sleep because I was stressing out about assignments), so I’m feeling pretty exhausted.

        Still, it was a good day.

      <p>
        I slept for 4 hours (1:10am to 5:30am). I think I’m hardwired to wake up around 5:00am. Could not concentrate for the entire day. Words became completely abstract. I’m constantly irritated. Complete loss of focus. I took a short nap in the
        afternoon, but it did little to cure my fatigue. I feel like I haven’t made much progress in school work today.

      <p>
        I have to sleep early tonight.

      <p>
        I didn’t get any sleep (10:40pm to 2:40am). I slept and woke up for rapidly for four hours until I finally got out of bed and made breakfast. Did not feel good for the entire day. Felt like I was going to have a heart attack every hour or so;
        wasn’t feeling very hungry either. I can’t help but feel that good sleep is reserved for the privileged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nah, I just have bad sleeping habits.

        I don’t want this to end on a sad note, so to whoever is reading this:
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re struggling out there, persevere, but also remember to get a good night’s sleep! It can be tough to do so, but I’m sure it will keep you energized and ready to tackle the day!
